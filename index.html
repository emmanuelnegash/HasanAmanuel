        Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more
        are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an
        imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other
        languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not
        how to achieve it).
      </p>
      <p>
        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components
        of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
      </p>
      <p>
        A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of
        instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages
        are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

        Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are
        programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than
        general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital
        computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th
        century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age

        There are a total of 53 letters in the Javanese script, but the number of
        represented phonemes (distinct sounds) varies accordingly to the language
        being written. Each letter represents a syllable, with an inherent vowel /a/
        or /ɔ/, which changes depending on the diacritics around the letter.
        Each consonant has a conjunct form called pasangan (“pair”), which nullifies
        the inherent vowel of the previous syllable.[5] In the word aksara for example,
        the inherent vowel of the
        letter ka is nullified by the use of pasangan in the following letter.

        Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions from geologic subduction
        between Sunda Plate and Australian Plate, Java is the 13th largest island
        in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800
        square kilometres (53,600 sq mi).

        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
        Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
         Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability
         with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language
         constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers
         write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects

          React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library[3] for
          building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
          individual developers and companies.

        Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world’s most popular
        front-end component library.Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing
        with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app
        with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt
        components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

      <p>
        AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained
        by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the
        challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify
        oth the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework
        for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures,
        along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.
